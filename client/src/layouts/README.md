## Layouts

This document assumes you have read the README about [Views](../views/README.md). Layouts are sidebars on the right that allow navigation between multiple views in one layer. Each one has 3 sections:

1. **Tabs** allow for navigation between views within a layer.
2. **Links** allow for navigation to outside the layer, or even to other websites!
3. **Settings** allow users to customize their experience, such as their color theme or language.
